## Overview

This is my first project that involved designing and implementing a basic travel destination website for a travel company. The website consists of four pages, including a Home Page and three Destination Pages for Iceland, Greece, and Hawaii. The project focuses on utilizing HTML, CSS, and component thinking to convert creative mockups into a functional multi-page static site.

## Tools & Resources

- **HTML and CSS**: Used for creating the structure and styling of the website.
- **Git and GitHub**: Employed version control to track changes and collaborate on the project.
- **Downloaded Assets & Mockups**: Utilized provided assets and mockups for visual design guidance.
- **Box Model, Flexbox, and CSS Positioning**: Implemented layout using these CSS concepts.
- **BEM Methodology**: Followed BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming classes in CSS.
- **Semantic Tags**: Used appropriate semantic tags (e.g., header, footer, nav) for better code structure.
- **Component Reusability**: Emphasized the reuse of styling and code, building around common components.

## Functional Requirements

### Home Page
- Navigation Bar with working links for each page.
- Logo linking to the Home page.
- Hero section with recommendations cards for each destination.
- Footer with consistent styling.

### Destination Pages
- Navigation Bar (Same as Home Page).
- 3 Itinerary Cards for a 3-day trip.
- Footer (Same as Home Page).

## Visual Design Requirements

- Matched mockups closely, considering image distortion and proportions.
- Consistent Navigation Bar and Footer styling across all pages.
- Used specified colors for backgrounds, text, buttons, and underlining.
- Implemented the recommended box shadow and border radius for destination cards.
- Applied styling to hero section and itinerary activities according to mockups.

## Implementation Requirements

- Organized file/folder structure following the Travel Site Structure Diagram.
- Separated CSS into a standalone stylesheet linked to HTML.
- Specified menu items using an unordered list for the Navigation Bar.
- Used `<a>` tags around destination cards for proper linking.
- Utilized unordered lists for itinerary activities.
- Emphasized code reuse, especially for destination cards and itinerary cards.

This project served as a foundational experience in applying HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional website. By following best practices, adhering to a consistent coding style, and incorporating design specifications, the project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development concepts and methodologies.
